# FEWD-Final-Assignment
Final Assignment for FEWD12

This is my final submission for General Assembly Front End Web Development 12 at GA in Melbourne
I've set out to producte a children's book in HTML as I wanted to do something interactive and with sound.

A copy of this site is hosted at http://paritybit.io/demo/inca/

It's a big site with all the sound files and images but it loads as required so the experience is reasonable. Enjoy the read!

Cheers, 
John
