					<p>The sun was shining but Inca was looking out of the windows with a glum expression on her face. It was near the end of school holidays and she hadn't been able to do anything interesting at all. Mum and Dad both worked at the cafe and unless she
						wanted to hang out there all day (no thank you!) she was stuck at home. Her best friend Maisie was away all holidays travelling through India with her family. She kept sending pictures of all these amazing places she was visiting . "I wish I could
						see the world on my own" thought Inca. "Then I could have my own adventures."

					<p>Desperate for something . . anything . . interesting, Inca raced out the door. Out in the garden was a gigantic balloon. Quite how or why it got here was anyone's guess. Inca sat down to blow the balloon up and see how big it was. After about 10
						minutes of huffing and puffing, the balloon was hardly taking shape - this balloon was huge! Inca set herself the challenge of seeing how big she could blow it up.</p>

					<p>After what seemed like ages, Inca stopped. She simply couldn't get any more air into the balloon but it still looked like it could get bigger. Inca put a big heavy garden rock on the bottom of the balloon and stood back to look at her handiwork.
						The balloon was really massive, "If I could find some string" , Inca thought, "I could float away with it and find some places I bet even Maisie hasn't seen yet". She searched the garden and found the rope her mum used to tie up the tomatoes. Inca
						tied the rope to the balloon, held onto the other end, pushed away the rock and the wind caught the balloon.</p>

						Inca looked at the tree, despite its size and beauty, it wasn't that exciting. Inca held tightly to the balloon as it lifted up in the air again "Thanks", she yelled down to the squirrel ,"but I’m looking for something a little more exciting! </p>

						when she first lifted off, the wind started to slow down and Inca gently drifted towards the park grounds, even though she was up in the air, Inca spotted a mouse scurrying about amongst the leaves.</p>

						food scraps left from the visitors to eat and I have a nice hollowed out log to live in". Eating food scraps didn't sound that exciting to Inca, she clung to the rope as the wind picked up and waved to the mouse as she took off again. </p>

						interesting things in Africa”. Walking that far didn’t seem like Inca’s thing so she waved goodbye and set of looking for someone else to visit. </p>

						interesting places to visit”. “This is an interesting place for giraffes”, they exclaimed. “You look more like a monkey, perhaps you should visit them if you don’t like leaves”. Inca took their advice and headed into the jungle canopy. </p>
